      <h1>Solar System</h1>
      <p>
        The Solar System consists of the Sun and all the objects that orbit it:
        <br/ > the eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids and
        comets. The
        <br />
        planets fall into two main groups: the rocky inner planets and the gas
        giant outer planets.

              Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our
              solar system, if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit
              inside. It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and
              gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago,
              But it has the shortest day in the solar system.
